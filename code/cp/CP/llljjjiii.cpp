offer rule
assign privilage 10%off offer, value, quantity

offer level:

Activity level:
all the activity have to be on the same transaction only (ex)
two condition are required for this thing with activity level, once activity is done it unset the variable
men clothing / women clothing + men accessories / women accessories

offer level:
activity can be on different days
airline can have multiple partners
=> fly, dine, rent car all of them  are independent 
fly with amirates, rent uber car,   => cummulative attribute that can't' be together all along

///////***************/////////////
BIT : behavioral, influence, transactional

Behavioural Value is incremented based on member behaviour
after joining the program like Online Ordering, Buying specific
product combinations, Frequency of purchase etc.

Influence Value is incremented based on the influential
activities by the member like new acquisitions based on
member referrals, sharing the offers online causing other
members to use those offers etc.

Transactional Value is incremented based on activities that
involve monetary payment

sponsor : entity participating in the program, like some brand to run theirown loyalty program


award is giving away : When you want to Offer a Product or Service that the members can acquire by paying for them in Points
privilage is king
reward redemmed 

batch : transaction => BIT




///////////////
docker helps to create the image that can be deployed over the web,

ECS
AWS ECS 
ESK (for kubernetes)
AWS Fargate



s3 : simple storage Service


aws glue : ETL (extract tranform load)
organize, move, transform and put them to use 
glue : serverless

air flow, step function
alpine based image

nomeclature in airflow
DAGS
operators : atomic component, descrbing a simple task
task : after a operation is instantiated, it's' referred as a task
task instance: reprsent a specific run of a  task
scheduling:  The DAGs and tasks can be run on demand or can be scheduled 


machine learning warkflow:
Data processing: 
      Raw data extrction, 
      cleansed data, 
      pythonOperator
Data transformation : 
     Test data, 
     Train data, 
     transformed to a sparse matrix with one-hot encoded feature vectors
     data = {data1 : 1, data2 : 2, data3 : 3}
     data = {data1 : [1, 0, 0], data2 : [0,1,0], data3 : [0,0,1]}
MODEL Training:
     run a hyperparameter tuning job to find the best model by running many jobs
MODEL Inference:
     Extend ml workflow by adding a task that can validate the the model performance
     (comparing actual and predicted results)




  ADVANTAGES:
  1. 








  There are 3 main types of operators:
Operators that performs an action, or tell another system to perform an action
Transfer operators move data from one system to another
Sensors are a certain type of operator that will keep running until a certain criterion is met. Examples include a specific file landing in HDFS or S3,
